## Test 3D Print Files

At the end of this project none of these will be what you'll use, but in the meantime you may find this useful.  Feel free to print these out or take a look and make any suggestions.

There will be multiple files in here, pay close attention to the file names (T0 vs T1 etc).

STEP files are in the zip folders if you want to get jiggy with 'em.
