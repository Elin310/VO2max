# VO2 Max Mask v 1.1
Project to build an affordable and adaptable VO2 Max mask.  Your "VO2 Max" is a measure of how much oxygen your body and absorb and use during exercise, read more about it [here](https://www.healthline.com/health/vo2-max#benefits).

Original idea and detailed build instructions can be found on [Instructable](https://www.instructables.com/Accurate-VO2-Max-for-Zwift-and-Strava/). Other designs can be found [here, a UC Davis Med Center project](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/knoesen/wp-content/uploads/sites/119/2016/12/OOCOO_WirelessHealthSubmission_Final.pdf) and a [commercial version that costs just under US$6,000](https://vo2master.com/).

This fork of [Meteoscientific](https://github.com/meteoscientific/VO2max) incorporates the CO2 enhancements from Ulrich Rissel.  The intent with this repo is to make a prototype that can be used by Sports technology at KTH and be adble to make future improvements.

## Design Constraints
Less than $200 for all parts and printing.
Printable by anyone with a 3D printer (easy print files).
Can handle up to 200 liters per minute of exhaled air.
Small and light enough to be worn for a full workout.
Able to measure resting as well maximum VO2.

## App Intent
Allows an athlete to monitor real time [RER](https://www.adinstruments.com/signal/rer#:~:text=Respiratory%20Exchange%20Ratio%20(RER)%20is,is%20operating%20aerobically%20or%20anaerobically.).

Allows an athlete to monitor gross mechanical efficiency

Allows for BLE or WiFi or ANT+ connections from any other sensor
- heart rate monitor
- stride rate or length
- power meter
- rowing stroke rate
  
## Versions
- V1 - Original version that works, can be found via the Instructable link above.
- V1.1 - Original version + CO2 and updated sensors due to availability
- V2 - Upgraded version by Urissel & Ivor, includes the CO2 & ambient temp/pressure to adapt to different elevation & temperatures.
- V3 - Proposed by Mahmoud, this is the T version.  Currently abandoned due to issues with getting correct sensor readings.
- V4 - Proposed by Stefan, affectionately called "The Snork".  Latest version.

## Current Status
Currently (Oktober 16th 2025) a work in progress:
The mask is built with the bill of materials under EU in the BOM file. 
The code for Arduino v1.1 has been updated with new sensor values. 
The battery is not installed and therefore neither is the on/off switch.
Future recommendations can be found in the [Final report](https://github.com/Elin310/VO2max/papers/VO2MaxMaskFINAL.pdf)

### Steps to Build & Use

## Order Sensors, board, and assorted fasteners.
Check the [BOM](https://github.com/Elin310/VO2max/blob/main/BOM.md) for all the various parts to order, they can take a week or two to come in.

## Print 3D Parts
Print out the 3D parts using PLA.

The 3D parts used is under the map 3D print files under arduino v1.1 map. The buttons are not a real match to the case and the on/off switch for the battery was the wrong one and need to be adjusted.

<br>Test fit all parts and make sure you know where everything goes; that will make the next steps much easier.

## Program Board
Originally this project was built with the Arduino IDE and we decided to continue on that.

## Wire It Up
See images for guidance under the folder images/arduino v1.1

## Assembly
Make sure to fit the sensor with the tubings, or adjust the 3D print file to reflect the actual diameter on the tube.

## Arduino
Source code for Arduino under "VO2Max" - Arduino board settings to use for TTGO T-Display:

    Board: ESP32 Dev Module
    Upload Speed: 921600
    CPU Frequency: 240Mhz (WiFi/BT)
    Flash Frequency: 80Mhz
    Flash Mode: QIO
    Flash Size: 4MB (32Mb)
    Partition Scheme: Default 4MB with spiffs (1.2MB APP/1.5 SPIFFS)
    Core Debug Level: None`

3D printing files are within the `design` folder, Ulrich Rissel's design files to use a larger venturi diameter with CO2 sensor holder in `design/CO2_upgrade`

## Usage - App
* Turn on device
* Add your weight (kg or lbs?)
* Push the Go button
* Turn on the Sensirion App, which will automatically pair and start recording data

Programing is done through the USB-C connector. 
(Charging the battery is accomplished by turning on the unit and then plugging it in.) - Not included in this version

The App is designed for collecting data from a CO2 sensor so you have to spoof it by sending the Volume Minute of O2 to the CO2 level screen, the VO2 max to the Temp screen and the O2 level to the Humidity screen. 


## Additional changes in this version:
- Menu system enhanced with adjustable calibration and setup options.
- Additional GoldenCheetah integration (with VO2 master output)
- CO2 sensor support (Ulrich's mods)
- Updated code, both .ino file and libraries to match the new sensors

## Running the unit on the [Sensirion MyAmbience app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sensirion-myambience/id1529131572) (iOS)
* VO2Max.ino
* DFRobot_OxygenSensor.cpp
* DFRobot_OxygenSensor.h
* Sensirion_GadgetBle_Lib.cpp
* Sensirion_GadgetBle_Lib.h
